# Graphic Score Bot Live

## A score generator for experimental musicians (and anyone else)

This is a direct fork of Kate Compton's Tracery repo and sample web app, because my JavaScript is absolutely horrible and I need to get this up and running ASAP!

Graphic Score Bot was born from a [Twitter bot](http://twitter.com/graphicscorebot) which remains live. It will be used as a kind of robot musical director for a live performer at Abandon Normal Devices' 'Art of Bots' show in April. I am attempting to set up a web app which will be able to generate full scores on demand for live use.

Longer-term ideas:

* <s>A temporal/slideshow-style system for performances in which the duration is also determined by the bot</s> DONE
* <s>An easier system for changing between colour schemes</s> DONE
* A check-box system to define which elements are present in a given score

Particular thanks to Kate Compton and George Buckenham for advice, resources, help with Cheap Bots Done Quick and Tracery, and borrowed code.
